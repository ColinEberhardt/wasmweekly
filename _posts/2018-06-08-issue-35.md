While most of the Rust / WebAssembly demos we are seeing are algorithmic (fractals, 3D etc ...), Blazor has a different focus. Most C# devs work on 'line of business' (LOB) applications. This blog post takes a step-by-step approach to building a simple LOB application, a shopping list.

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

There are now a small number of production-ready libraries using WebAssembly, and this is another one. Secp256k1 is an elliptical hash algorithm which is used by blockchain clients.
 
### And Finally ...

Did you know that you can [breakpoint Rust code within FireFox](https://twitter.com/ColinEberhardt/status/1004596556589387776)? Yes, we have sourcemaps!
