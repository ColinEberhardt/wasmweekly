It has been a vey busy week for WebAssembly - for the first time in 27 issues of this newsletter I've had to make some significant editorial decisions, rather than just listing all the wasm news!

## Latest News

### [Conway's Game of Life in Rust](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-wasm/game-of-life/introduction.html)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

A really detailed tutorial on creating a simple application using Rust. The tutorial covers wasm basics, memory management, the new wasm-bindgen tool, profiling, and much more. This is the best place to start if you are new to Rust.

### [Sneak Peak at WebAssembly Studio](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/04/sneak-peek-at-webassembly-studio/)

<small>MOZILLA.ORG</small>

If you've been keeping up with your wasm news, you'll have seen WasmFiddle rapidly evolving into WebAssembly Studio, adding Rust and AssemblyScript support. I must admit, I hadn't realised this was a Mozilla project - which does explain why it is moving so quickly!

### [Learning the WebAssembly type system](https://maurobringolf.ch/2018/04/learning-the-webassembly-type-system/)

<small>MAUROBRINGOLF.CH</small>

Mauro Bringolf takes a closer look at the underlying WebAssembly type system and how to enforce the type checking rules detailed in the specification.

### [Writing An NES Emulator with Rust and WebAssembly](https://medium.com/@bokuweb17/writing-an-nes-emulator-with-rust-and-webassembly-d64de101c49d)

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

We saw RustyNES appear on the internet a while back. In this post the author takes you through the emulator structure and shares their experience of building it using Rust and WebAssembly. A fantastic read!

### And The Rest ...
 - [Trail](https://github.com/panesofglass/trail) - bringing F# to Blazor
 - A [bug was discovered in WebKit's wasm parser](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1522), which opens up a security hole
 - This post looks at what [bundling WebAssembly will look like for C](https://www.xtuc.fr/notes/bundling-webassembly-c.html)
 - Kevin Hoffman has started a new [WebAssembly tutorial](https://medium.com/@KevinHoffman/in-search-of-webassembly-2c96ad1d6fe2), which looks very good
 - You can now see [Python running in the browser](https://iodide-project.github.io/pyodide-demo/python.html) thanks to WebAssembly

### And Finally ...

WebAssembly received [some attention from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/11/17207964/web-apps-quality-pwa-webassembly-houdini), alongside PWAs and Houdini, a couple of other technologies worth watching.
