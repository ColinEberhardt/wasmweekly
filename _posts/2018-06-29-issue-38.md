### [Even better Source Maps with C++, WebAssembly and Cheerp](https://medium.com/leaningtech/even-better-source-maps-with-c-webassembly-and-cheerp-d872276b7d3c)

A few months ago the Mozilla team published a [really interesting blog post](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/) about migrating a complex JavaScript-based library, that parses source-maps, to Rust + WebAssembly. They demonstrated a x3 increase in performance and much cleaner code.

This post repeats the same process but using C++ and the Cheerp compiler instead. It showcases an interesting hybrid approach where some of the C++ code is compiled to wasm, and some is compiled to JS, generating the necessary 'wrapper' around the wasm module. Fascinating stuff! 

 
### [Our Vision for Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/06/25/vision-for-rust-and-wasm.html)

We all know that WebAssembly isn't going to replace JavaScript (not immediately at least). This blog posts provides a thoroughly practical overview of how to Rust and JavaScript will co-exist together, "Surgically inserting Rust compiled to WebAssembly should be the best choice for speeding up the most performance-sensitive JavaScript code paths"

Nebulet is a WebAssembly-based microkernel, turning WebAssembly into an OS! This post gives a little background on "why?"
