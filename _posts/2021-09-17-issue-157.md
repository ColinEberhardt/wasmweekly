## [Running JavaScript in WebAssembly with WasmEdge](https://www.thetechplatform.com/post/running-javascript-in-webassembly-with-wasmedge)

<small>THETECHPLATFORM.COM</small>

"Hang on", I hear you say, "WebAssembly runs within JavaScript, why would you want to run JavaScript within WebAssembly?". Good question!

WebAssembly is increasingly being used as a universal runtime for cloud applications, for example as a host for serverless / [FaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) or  for sidecar applications in a service mesh. However, in those cloud-native use cases, developers often want to use JavaScript to write business applications. That means supporting JavaScript applications within a WebAssembly runtime.

This blog post describes how to run the QuickJS JavaScript engine within the WasmEdge WebAssembly runtime. How the tables have turned!

## [WebAssembly Where it Belongs: In the Cloud](https://blog.container-solutions.com/webassembly-in-the-cloud)

While the above article alludes to the many uses of WebAssembly in the cloud, this article takes a deep-dive. First, it looks at what makes this runtime so appealing, followed by a number of different cloud-computing examples. 

Minor point - it is great to see people getting so excited about WebAssembly as a cloud computing runtime. I share that excitement. However, WebAssembly doesn't belong in the cloud. It belongs in the browser, the cloud and on IOT devices. It belongs everywhere.

Disney have enjoyed considerable success with Disney+, their direct-to-consumer streaming product, most likely having benefited from COVID. Similar to Netflix and other streaming providers, there is considerable demand from partners who want to embed Disney+ into their own set-top boxes and other hardware. Tackling this is a considerable challenge, "... weâ€™d need to build an incredibly portable runtime that would run on everything from 10+ year old MIPS based devices to modern x64 processors and GPUs." WebAssembly was key to the solution.

The Application Developer Kit (ADK), contains a WebAssembly runtime, that hosts the client application, which is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. This results in a platform-independent client application, which is downloaded from the internet, allowing for rapid deployment of application updates.

Time for a flashy demo - this time, a Rust, WebAssembly and WebGL fluid simulation. You can find the [sourcecode on GitHub](https://github.com/cerrno/pcisph-wasm).

Yes, we do have a growing problem with digital content that we can no-longer realistically access because the hardware or software 'player' has reached end-of-life. However, I think it is a bit harsh to 'blame Flash'. This is a fact of life for technology. Anyhow, on a more positive note, this article does mention [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle), a Rust / WebAssembly re-implementation of Flash.
