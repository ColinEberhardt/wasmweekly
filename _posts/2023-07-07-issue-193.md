## [Timecraft - The WebAssembly Time Machine](https://github.com/stealthrocket/timecraft)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

Timecraft is a software runtime that executes WebAssembly modules with sandboxing, task orchestration, and time travel capabilities. This is a fascinating concept, I encountered time-travel debugging a number of years ago via React / Redux. Extending this capability to a distributed system is an interesting idea.

## [Understanding Wasm](https://www.neversaw.us/2023/05/10/understanding-wasm/part1/virtualization/)

<small>NEVERSAW.US</small>

This is part one of a series, [part two is here](https://www.neversaw.us/2023/06/30/understanding-wasm/part2/whence-wasm/), with a combined reading time of about 70 minutes, this is practically a book already! I've not read this content yet, but I applaud the authors dedication.

## [WASIX undermines WebAssembly System Interface spec](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3700569/wasix-undermines-webassembly-system-interface-spec-bytecode-alliance-says.html)

<small>INFORWORLD.COM</small>

I covered this in the last issue, a group hae started a new interface specification called WASIX. The goal is to extend WASI to accelerate the development of APIs for non-browser based WebAssembly. This article briefly highlights why the Bytecode Alliance, the team behind WASI, think this is a bad idea.

I'm staying neutral on this one - leaving it to you to work out whether you think this is a good move or not.

## [Embrace the Kinda](https://blog.sunfishcode.online/embrace-the-kinda/)

<small>SUNFISHCODE.ONLINE</small>

This blog post reviews the various pithy sentences that have been used to describe WebAssembly, finding them all lacking. To this author, WebAssembly seems to defy all definitions. Kinda.

## [The Cloud is dead, long live the Cloud!](https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wasmer-edge)

<small>WASMER.IO</small>

Wasmer have been around for a while now. They are one of the WebAssembly early-adopters, providing a runtime with broad language support. They have now branched out into becoming a cloud platform, with the announcement of Wasmer Edge.

## [Build Zellij WebAssembly (Rust) Plugins for your Terminal](https://zellij.dev/news/new-plugin-system/)

<small>ZELLIJ.DEV</small>

Zellij is a terminal workspace which can be extended via plugins, which (you've guessed it) are executed within a WebAssembly runtime. This blog post shows you how to build a plugin.
