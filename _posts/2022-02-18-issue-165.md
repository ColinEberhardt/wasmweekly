## [LibreOffice running on WebAssembly](https://lab.allotropia.de/wasm/)

<small>ALLOTROPIA.DE</small>

LibreOffice is a free an open source productivity suite, with a word processor, spreasdheet and various other standard office tools. It has a very long heritage, starting as a fork of OpenOffice, which is around 20 years old. The team behind LibreOffice have been working on a WebAssmebly port for a little while, using the Emscripten compiler (for C++), and [Qt for WebAssembly](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly) for the UI layer. I think this is the first time that a useable demo has been widely circulated.

If you want to hear more about the details, there is an [accompanying talk from FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/lotech_lowa/).

This WebAssembly powered game is absolutely gorgeous - just tap your mouse to build a townscape.

OK, I guess it isn't much of a _game_ in the strictest sense, in that there isn't much to do beyond just clicking. But wow, it does look good!

## [Making a budget Pascal compiler to WebAssembly](https://faizilham.github.io/making-budget-pascal-compiler)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

Pascal, that takes me back a few years. I think that was one of the first programming languages I learnt around 30 years ago! The author of this post decided to write their own Pascal-to-WebAssembly compiler, because, why not? having dabbled with writing a simple WebAssembly compiler, I'd thoroughly encourage anyone to give this a go. It is a lot of fun.

## [How we built our data transformation engine with the Wasm runtime](https://redpanda.com/blog/data-transformation-engine-with-wasm-runtime/)

<small>REDPANDA.COM</small>

Redpanda is a streaming platform that is an alternative to the hugely popular Kafka, that allows you to add inline transforms via their WebAssembly engine. This is a bit like serverless functions specifically for Kafka. This blog post talks about why they picked WebAssembly, and delves into the technical details.
