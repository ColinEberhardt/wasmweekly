## [WebAssembly 2.0 First Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-2/)

<small>W3.ORG</small>

The first WebAssembly draft specification was published by W3C, the same organisation that manages the HTML, and CSS specifications [among others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium). The first iteration of WebAssembly was always [intended to be an MVP](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/) (minimum viable product), providing the capabilities required to move some challenging workloads into the browser, for example Google Earth and the Unreal game engine.

Since then, numerous new features have been added to the specification, culminating in the recently published v2.0 working draft. For a quick summary of what's been added, take a look at this [comment on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31088412).

Considering that WebAssembly is becoming such a popular runtime, I wanted to have a go at creating a simple serverless platform myself!

In this blog post I explore the Wasmtime WebAssembly runtime, and build a WebAssembly-powered serverless platform in just 70 lines of code. It really is quite easy to incorporate WebAssembly into your product.

Making reference to the W3C v2.0 specification above, one of the features that hasn't been added to WebAssembly yet is garbage collection. This blog post demonstrates how, with a bit of JavaScript glue code, you can use Weak References from the JavaScript runtime to achieve similar results.
