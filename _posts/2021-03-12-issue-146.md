### [VM Matters: A Comparison of WASM VMs and EVMs in the Performance of Blockchain Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01032.pdf)

<small>ARXIV.ORG</small>

WebAssembly a fast become the runtime of choice for blockchain implementations, with Ethereum (the biggest blockchain network second only to Bitcoin) looking to adopt this technology in their v2 architecture. The current version of Ethereum has its own virtual machine that runs a language called Solidity and it is expected that the new eWASM virtual machine will be faster. But will it?

This paper puts eWASM to the test, and the results are a little disappointing. Digging into the details it appears that the virtual machine itself is fast, but there are significant overheads. Presumably this is much like the overheads involved in integration JavaScript and WebAssembly, and these will diminish over time.
