<code>MOZILLA.ORG</code>

When you see  new blog post from Lin Clark appear, you know you're in for a treat! - In this post Lin discusses how the design of WebAssembly allows compilation to start before the entire module is downloaded. Mozilla now compiles WebAssemby across multiple threads in parallel, allowing it to compile faster than the network can deliver the code!

This is another great (and epic) post from Mozilla, here Nick and Tom describe the work they've been doing to take the source-map JavaScript library and migrate it to Rust. This allows them to compile it to WebAssembly resulting in a x5 performance boost. This highly detailed blog post shares their findings.


### [Mono and WebAssembly - Updates on Static Compilation](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2018/01/16/mono-static-webassembly-compilation/)

<code>MONO-PROJECT.COM</code>

The Mono team have been exploring two different approaching to bringing C# to the web, the first is a WebAssembly interpreter that processes the .NET Intermediate Language within the browser. The second, more efficient, approach is static compilation of C# into WebAssembly. This blog post gives an update on how this work is progressing.
