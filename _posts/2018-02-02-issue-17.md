### [Shrinking WebAssembly and JavaScript Code Sizes in Emscripten](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/shrinking-webassembly-and-javascript-code-sizes-in-emscripten/)

Emscripten is the 'original' tool for compiling to WebAssembly. It is built on the LLVM compiler toolchain, with its own Fastcomp backend that generates asm.js, and produced many of the early game-engine demos.

Thankfully that has changed, this post describes how a simple 'add' example has slimmed down from 10,837 to 42 bytes!

The number of meetup and conference talks on WebAssembly is starting to increase as news of this technology spreads. This is a particularly good introduction.
