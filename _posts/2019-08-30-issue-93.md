### [Wasm vs. PNaCl Performance Benchmark](https://www.pdftron.com/blog/wasm/wasm-vs-pnacl/)

<small>PDFTRON.COM</small>

Before the the WebAssembly team was put together in 2015 Google was working on its next iteration of the plugin model with PNaCl (catchy?!) which stands for Portable Network Client. PNaCl used a machine independent instruction set that was executed within a sandbox, however, it failed to gain traction and was retired by 2017 in favour of WebAssembly.

The PDFTron team had been using PNaCl for their client-side PDF rendering engine with some very good results. In this blog post they take a look at how WebAssembly, and the newly added threading support, compares. The conclusions? A little mixed - there are a number of missing features that make it hard to use in practice, however the PDFTron team are optimistic for the future.
