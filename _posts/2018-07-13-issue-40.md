### [Vim editor ported to WebAssembly](https://github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

Vim is a very popular text-based editor that has been around for more than 25 years. This GitHub project is a work-in-progress port of Vim to WebAssembly using the emscripten C compiler. The readme file gives a good technical overview of how this project works.

This project has gained a lot of attention this week, although most relate to the age old joke of ["how do you exit vim?"](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/). In this case it is quite simple - just close the tab!

I love emulators and 8 bit computers! What's better than an 8-bit emulator? Six of them!

This website demos a Commodore C64, ZX Spectrum, Acorn Atom and others, all compiled to WebAssembly using emscripten. You can find the [C sourcecode for all of them on GitHub](https://github.com/floooh/chips).

Now that Go officially supports WebAssembly we're going to see a lot of creativity in this area. This blog post looks at improving the WebAssembly / JavaScript interface.
