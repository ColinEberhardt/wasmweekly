### [WebAssembly and Rust: Performance Analysis](https://www.polaris64.net/blog/programming/2018/webassembly-wasm-rust-webgl-mandelbrot-performance-analysis)

<small>POLARIS64.NET</small>

This blog post compares a mandelbrot algorithm implemented in JavaScript, versus a WebAssembly equivalent written in Rust. As previous results have shown, the JavaScript implementation is really quite fast! [As we saw last week](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/), WebAssembly's performance sweet spot is significantly faster parse and load times, not runtime performance.

### [Astro - a new language that targets WebAssembly](https://github.com/appcypher/astro)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

It is taking a while for garbage collected languages to provide WebAssembly support, which is leaving room for some creativity! Astro is a new multi-paradigm language designed specifically for WebAssembly.

### Bundler wars, Parcel vs. Webpack

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

This week has seen significant releases from a couple of web bundlers, first Parcel, a recent newcomer, [released v1.5 with WebAssembly support](https://medium.com/@devongovett/parcel-v1-5-0-released-source-maps-webassembly-rust-and-more-3a6385e43b95). Parcel has a zero-config design, which means you can just write Rust code, and import it into JavaScript and Parcel will do the rest!

Hot on its heels, [Webpack 4.0 beta was released](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-beta-try-it-today-6b1d27d7d7e2), providing WebAssembly support for C++, Rust and various other languages using their 'loader' pattern.

### And Finally ...

WebAssembly is spreading ... this pull request looks at [replacing the C++ code in node-sass with WebAssembly](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/pull/2220). Soon everyone will be using WebAssembly, without even knowing it!
