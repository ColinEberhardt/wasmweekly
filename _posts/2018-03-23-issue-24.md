### [Get started building .NET web apps that run in the browser with Blazor](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/03/22/get-started-building-net-web-apps-in-the-browser-with-blazor/)

<small>MICROSOFT.COM</small>

It was only a few weeks ago that Blazor, an open source project by Steve Sanderson, was adopted by Microsoft. This blog post announces an impressive looking 'preview' release. Definitely of interest for C# .NET devs wanting to target the web. For a good background on how Blazor works I'd recommend [Steve's earlier blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/03/22/get-started-building-net-web-apps-in-the-browser-with-blazor/).

Of course, the hype-machine is in full swing, with the Visual Studio magazine declaring ['Death to JavaScript'](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2018/03/23/blazor-alpha.aspx). The [comments on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/86efaa/first_official_preview_of_aspnet_blazor_released/) are also a fun read if you've got a few hours to spare. Either way, there are a whole lot of people who bet on Silverlight, who are a little happier now!

### [Quick Sort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quicksort.wasm)

<small>NPMJS.ORG</small>

This is the first 'pure wasm' module I've seen on npm. It's a simple quick-sort algorithm, written directly in WebAssembly wat text format. I'm sure we'll see more of these in future!

### [A Rust Framework for making Client Web Apps](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew)

<small>GITHUB.ORG</small>

Yew is a modern Rust framework inspired by Elm and ReactJS, bringing Rust another step closer to being a first-class language for the web.

### And Finally ...

The Ember team announced that [they are replacing their core VM with WebAssembly](https://twitter.com/WasmWeekly/status/976033248806686722), written in Rust.
