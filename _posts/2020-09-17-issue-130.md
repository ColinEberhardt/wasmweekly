### [QuantumSheet](https://github.com/stefnotch/quantum-sheet/)

<small>github.com</small>

QuantumSheet is a web based computer algebra system, or as they like to call it themselves, a fancy calculator. This tool was built using [Sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy), a Python algebra system that allows you to solve equations, perform calculus and a whole host of other algebraic functions. QuantumSheet uses [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide), which brings the Python runtime to the browser. Finally, MathLive, a TypeScript UI for maths input is used to provide the front-end to the SymPy calculation engine. This is an amazing demonstration of the promise of WebAssembly, allowing developers to use powerful and established modules and libraries within their applications.

Blazor applications are a little heavyweight, loading the .NET runtime into the browser then your applications DLLs. This blog post looks at how to enable lazy loading in order to defer some of these downloads.

Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open standard for container images. Solo have been active in the integration of WebAssembly into Envoy Proxy. This specification defines how to bundle Wasm modules as OCI images.

### [Adding experimental WebAssembly support to Decaton â€“ Part 1](https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog/adding-experimental-webassembly-support-to-decaton-part-1/)

Decaton is a streaming task processing framework built on top of Apache Kafka, where tasks are run on a JVM (Java Virtual Machine), as a result the languages that people can use to write tasks is restricted to JVM languages (i.e. Java, Scala). This blog post takes a look at how WebAssembly can bee integrated into Decaton allowing many other languages to target this platform.
