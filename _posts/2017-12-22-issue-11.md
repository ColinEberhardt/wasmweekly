### [WebAssembly Raytracer](https://sniklaus.com/blog/raytracer)

<small>SNIKLAUS.COM</small>

A simplistic raytracer written in C++, and compiled to wasm via Emscripten, compared with JavaScript, asm.js and shader implementations. This is a really fascinating comparison, with performance measurements, that generated a lot of debate on both [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7k4v5t/a_raytracer_in_js_4073_ms_and_in_wasm_874_ms_and/) and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15939036).

### [Introduction to WebAssembly - Why Should We Care?](https://tomassetti.me/introduction-to-webassembly/)

<small>TOMASSETTI.ME</small>

There are many articles that introduce WebAssembly, but this one does a particularly good job, highlighting the parse speed as well as runtime performance, " ... this increase in parsing performance alone will permit to put on the web software that would have been impractical to develop before."

### [Current State of WebAssembly Podcast](https://modernweb.podbean.com/e/s04e14-webassembly/)

<small>PODBEAN.COM</small>

A fun and interesting podcast from a small group of wasm enthusiasts, covering topics including why WebAssembly matters, how Webpack wasm support is evolving. And something about beards.

### [Color Palettes](https://novoselrok.github.io/color-palette-wasm/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

A neat little demo that generates color palettes, using a k-means algorithm. It includes the sourcecode, which is written in C and compiled with Emscripten.

### And finally ...

You can [run WebAssembly on your washing machine](https://github.com/piranna/wasmachine) (in plain English, this is wasm running on an FPGA), and for readers in the UK, an [interesting analogy between Brexit and Silverlight](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams/status/943295390522200064)!
