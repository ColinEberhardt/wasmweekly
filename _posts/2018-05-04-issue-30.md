The LLVM is a modular compiler infrastructure that is a vital part of WebAssembly. In this issue we look into this technology in a bit more detail.

### [Ruby on WebAssembly](http://www.blacktm.com/blog/ruby-on-webassembly)

<small>BLACKTM.COM</small>

A really interesting article that doesn't start with asm.js or WebAssembly, but instead looks at the history of LLVM, and how it was designed "usher in a new era of software development where applications can freely move from machine to machine and even from processor to processor" - the article then moves on to describe the current status of WebAssembly support for Ruby, delving into the details. 

### [Using LLVM from Rust, to generate WebAssembly](https://medium.com/@jayphelps/using-llvm-from-rust-to-generate-webassembly-93e8c193fdb4)

Based on the title it probably sounds like this article is about compiling Rust to WebAssembly. Well, it isn't! This article is about writing your own compiler using the LLVM backend. Time to create your own esoteric language and compile it to WebAssembly!

### [Overview of LLVM](http://aosabook.org/en/llvm.html)

If you enjoyed the above two posts and want to find out a little more about LLVM, this post from Chris Lattner (principal author and founder of Swift), might be of interest.

## And The Rest ...

 - [Cervus](https://github.com/cervus-v/cervus/blob/master/README.md) - a WebAssembly sub-system for linux. Yes, another ring-0, 'metal' runtime for wasm!
 - [BlazeDown](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/blazedown-experiment-with-markdown-and-blazor?utm_medium=social-owned&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=devcraft-blog-markdown-and-blazor) - building a markdown editor wth Blaze
 - [Performance testing JS vs. wasm](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/performance-testing-web-assembly-vs-javascript-e07506fd5875) - a nice idea, but I fear this is a microbenchmark and probably unreliable!

### And Finally ...

I'm going to be [speaking about WebAssembly at a meetup in London](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/webassembly-and-the-death-of-javascript-tickets-45755178972?aff=twreg) in a couple of weeks tie - go me! ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢
