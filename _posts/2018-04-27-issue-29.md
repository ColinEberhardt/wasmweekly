In this issue we're going deep - with a couple of articles that explore the WebAssembly instruction set in more detail ...

## [Writing WebAssembly by Hand](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html)

WebAssembly was designed as a compilation target / runtime for a wide range of higher-level programming languages. However, it is surprisingly easy to write by hand! This blog post explores the WAT text format and looks at implementing Conway's Game of Life.

## [How does Dynamic Dispatch work in WebAssembly?](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/04/26/how-does-dynamic-dispatch-work-in-wasm.html)

Dynamic dispatch is a technique that allows language to dynamically determine which implementation of an operation to invoke at runtime. It is a feature of most programming languages, although they differ in exactly how it is implemented.

This post explores the WebAssembly call_indirect instruction, which allows dynamic invocation of functions. It also compares how the same dynamic code (written in Rust) differs when compiled to WebAssembly and x86. Fascinating stuff!

## And The Rest ...
 - [The Web Assembles](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/24/the-web-assembles.html) - a white paper that looks at why we need WebAssembly, and how it will effect the future of web development 
 - [Blazor, Razor, WebAssembly, and Mono - How the pieces fit together](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/04/23/beta-qt-webassembly-technology-preview/) - an interesting post that describes how the pieces in this complex puzzle all fit together!
 - [Code cartoons, Rust and WebAssembly](http://podplayer.net/#/?id=49589095) - a podcast with Lin Clark

### And Finally ...

What if there were a [physical CPU that executed WebAssembly](https://github.com/lastmjs/wasm-metal/blob/master/README.md)? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
