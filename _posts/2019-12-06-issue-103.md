### [Announcing GraalWasm â€” a WebAssembly engine in GraalVM](https://medium.com/graalvm/announcing-graalwasm-a-webassembly-engine-in-graalvm-25cd0400a7f2)

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

GraalVM is a high performance runtime that was launched relatively recently. Its primary goal is to improve the performance of Java virtual machine-based languages to match the performance of native languages. With GraalWasm the team have embedded a WebAssembly virtual machine within their runtime, further increasing the number of languages that can run (and enjoy lightweight interop) within their runtime. Exciting stuff!
 
### [SwiftLaTeX](https://www.swiftlatex.com/ide/ide.html?pid=swiftlatex_foo&share_id=&share=false)

LaTeX is a popular document markup language that is used extensively in academia. SwiftLaTeX provides a WYSIWYG editor for LaTeX documents, with the rendering powered by WebAssembly. The sourcecode for can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/SwiftLaTeX/SwiftLaTeX), however, the wasm module is checked in as a binary, so it is not clear how it was built - which is a shame.

### [Using WebAssembly from .NET with Wasmtime](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/12/using-webassembly-from-dotnet-with-wasmtime/)

<small>MOZILLA.ORG</small>

Wasmtime is the WebAssembly runtime that is being supported by the newly-formed Bytecode Alliance. This blog post announces a .NET Core integration for their runtime, which allows you to integrate wasm modules into .NET applications.
