### [Windows 2000 emulated in WebAssembly](https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=https://bellard.org/jslinux/win2k.cfg&mem=192&graphic=1&w=1024&h=768)

<small>BELLARD.ORG</small>

This is without a doubt one of the most awesome WebAssembly demos we've seen so far, a fully-functional Windows 2000 emulator! This is the creation of Fabrice Bellard who has created a number of emulators over the years. This one originally used emscripten to generate asm.js, the recent move to wasm has boosted performance.

As you can image, the twitter-verse loved this, with most people heading straight for minesweeper or pinball. Even more amazing is that the emulator has network access, allowing you to see that [Google still supports IE5](https://twitter.com/ivanandsickle/status/1032589493822341122) and [run Firefox 12 (within Firefox 61)](https://twitter.com/bealdav/status/1032626224785436672).

Of course there were many of the obligatory references to Gary Bernhardt's [Birth & Death of JavaScript talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript), which does seem to be quite accurate in its predictions. If you've not seen that presentation before, stop what you are doing and watch it right now!
 
### [Chrome Introduces LiftOff](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/08/liftoff.html)

<small>BLOGSPOT.ORG</small>

Ideally the techniques that are used to compile and execute WebAssembly (and JavaScript) have to compile quickly, giving fast start-up times, but also be optimised so that the code runs as quickly as possible. Achieving both of these aims, fast compilation and execution, is a challenge, with the two goals often being in conflict. This blog post describes a new baseline compiler for Chrome called LiftOff, that dramatically reduces the initial compilation. Following this, the current TurboFan compile 'kicks in', to boost the runtime performance.

### [FrogUI](https://www.lesarde.com/)

FrogUI is a new framework that brings C#, and the WPF style of UI development, to the web. It looks like Blazor has some competition!

### And Finally ...

Who needs Blazor, when you can run C# within the Windows 2000 emulator?
