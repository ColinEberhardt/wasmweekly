### [WebAssemblyâ€™s post-MVP future: A cartoon skill tree](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/)

<small>MOZILLA.ORG</small>

Another fantastic article, with accompanying cartoons, from Lin Clark. This article takes you on a journey through the various use-cases (skills) that WebAssembly can be used for, weaving in the various proposals and other innovations. It makes for a fantastic read.

Even if you are familiar with the current state of WebAssembly, I'd thoroughly recommend reading to the end, where the article looks way beyond the browser.
 
### [Multithreading Rust and Wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/10/24/multithreading-rust-and-wasm.html)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

A really detailed article that walks through the threading proposal, shared memory and atomics. As well as describing the various challenges, the author presents a working demo, using an example ray tracer. Interestingly this code was not written specifically for the demo, the author found, and adapted, an existing Rust project.

### [Welcome to WebPerl!](https://webperl.zero-g.net/)

<small>ZERO-G.NET</small>

Time to welcome another language to the WebAssembly family, this time it's Perl 5.

### And Finally ...

PSPDFKit, one of the companies that pioneered the use of WebAssembly, [are looking to hire](https://remote.jobs/programming/8259/).
