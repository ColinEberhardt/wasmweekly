## [WebAssembly should be a default binary target](https://dev.to/taybenlor/web-assembly-should-be-a-default-binary-target-44m6)

<small>DEV.TO</small>

I really enjoyed this article, it's relatively brief (funny) and to the point - WebAssembly, for a great many reasons, is shaping up to be a fantastic universal runtime. The author argues that we should be making WebAssembly our default binary target and running WebAssembly everywhere.

... with a few good jokes at Java's expense thrown in for good measure ðŸ¤£

## [Aggregate streaming data in real-time with WebAssembly](https://www.infinyon.com/blog/2021/08/smartstream-aggregates/)

On the subject of WebAssembly becoming a universal runtime ... [Fluvio](https://www.infinyon.com/blog/2021/06/introducing-fluvio/#fluvio-programmable-platform-for-data-in-motion) is a distributed streaming platform for real-time data. Historically many data-processing tasks have been executed in 'batch mode', for example, an online shop might run a batch process at the end of each data in order to generate summary reports based on the days sales. However, in many instances there are advantages to running these data-processing tasks in real-time, giving more immediate insight. 

Streaming platforms are distributed by their very nature, being composed of event streams and processing nodes. WebAssembly, with its portability, multi-language support and security, is an ideal runtime for these processing nodes. This blog post gives a practical introduction to writing an aggregation node for Fluvio in Rust.

## [Shaking Off the Rust 2: Ray Tracing in WebAssembly](https://clayto.com/2021/07/shaking-off-the-rust-2-ray-tracing-in-webassembly/)

Fractals, the Game of Life and Ray Tracing are all classic programming tasks that are great vehicle for learning a new language or framework. In this blog post, the author creates a simple Ray Tracer as a way to better understand Rust and WebAssembly.

## [WASM-4 Build retro games using WebAssembly for a fantasy console](https://wasm4.org/)

<small>WASM4.ORG</small>

I've always been a fan of emulators, bringing old computer games and technology back to life. However, Wasm4 is something different, rather than emulate a real console (from the past), it is a 'fantasy' console. Wasm4 uses WebAssembly as its runtime (the CPU), adding a simple set of APIs for rendering to the screen, playing sounds, or handling input.

Maybe Wasm4 should team up with [Wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3) and get this fantasy console running on real hardware?
