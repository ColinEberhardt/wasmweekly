## [MicroW8](https://exoticorn.github.io/microw8/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

MicroW8 is a fantasy console - in other words, it is a virtual architecture inspired by the types of console some of us used to play and own a few decades ago, but is a console that never actually existed. 

I love this stuff!

MicroW8 runs wasm modules of up to 256Kbtyes which can make use of a [simple API](https://exoticorn.github.io/microw8/docs/) which has various functions for creating graphics and supporting user input. If you like this sort of stuff, you might be interested in [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/), a slightly more established virtual console. I'd also encourage you to try writing your own - it will be a lot of fun.

## [WAPM: A Newly Renovated Home For WebAssembly](https://wasmer.io/posts/wapm-revamp)

<small>WASMER.IO</small>

Wasmer were one of the first companies to create a WebAssembly runtime, which they rapidly integrated with a whole host of different languages and runtimes. As well as providign a runtime, they are supporting the WebAssembly ecosystem in other ways, including this project WAPM, a wasm module repository - think npm for WebAssembly. This blog post shares a number of updates to the WAPM website, which is looking pretty smart. 

## [Rethinking Microservices](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/rethinking-microservices)

<small>FERMYON.IO</small>

Do you recall in [issue 164](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-164/) the lead article [Pay Attention to WebAssembly](https://harshal.sheth.io/2022/01/31/webassembly.html)? If not, go back and read it now! One of the many predictions Harshal Sheth made in that post was that WebAssembly will cause us to re-shape the ever-popular microservices pattern. Which is funnily enough the topic of this blog post.

This is a fantastic blog post that takes a critical look at the various assumptions that microservices architectures are built on (e.g. that every microserice needs to be a webserver)

> What if we took the strong points of FaaS and ported them over to the microservice model? Could we build a better foundation for microservice architecture?

Very thought provoking.


## [How We Used WebAssembly To Speed Up Our Web App By 20X](https://wp-dd.com/how-we-used-webassembly-to-speed-up-our-web-app-by-20x-case-study-smashing-magazine/)

<small>WP-DD.COM</small>

I hear there are still some folks using WebAssembly on the web? Yeah, proper old-school ðŸ¤£

Joking aside, this is a really good article which explores how WebAssembly improved the performance of an online DNA sequencing tool.

## [Let's explore code signing with WebAssembly](https://blog.nishtahir.com/lets-explore-code-signing-with-webassembly/)

<small>NISHTAHIR.COM</small>

Code signing is an important and useful tool for verifying the integrity of a library, application or product. It provides a guarantee that it was produced by a known party, and that it hasn't been tampered with. This post shows you how to add a custom section to a wasm module in order to sign and verify its authenticity.

## And Finally ... 

The 2021 state of JavaScript survey shows that [WebAssembly usage is on the rise](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/features/other-features/#wasm).
