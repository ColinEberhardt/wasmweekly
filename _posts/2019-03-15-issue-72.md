### [pyckitup - a Python game engine for the Web](https://pickitup247.com/pyckitup.html#pyckitup)

<small>PICKITUP247.COM</small>

This project uses the popular RustPython interpreter (i.e. a Python interpreter written in Rust), which is compiled to WebAssembly.  This is combined with quicksilver, a simple Rust 2D game engine, to allow you to create Python games that run in the browser.interpreter to quicksilver game engine. 

### [Assembling the Future of Smart Contracts with Sawtooth Sabre](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/02/08/assembling-the-future-of-smart-contracts-with-sawtooth-sabre)

Blockchain and the bitcoin currency it supports perform relatively simple transactions on the blockchain's distributed ledger. Smart contracts take this concept a step further, allowing the encoding of much more complex contract logic onto a distributed ledger - resulting an immutable contract. WebAssembly is proving to be a very popular option for contract engines, allowing contracts to be written in a wide range of languages on the 'secure' wasm runtime.

Ghidra is a tool, that the NSA recently open sourced, for reverse engineering. This blog post takes a look at creating a wasm loader for Ghidra, allowing it to reverse engineer WebAssembly.
