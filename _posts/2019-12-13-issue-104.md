### [W3C Recommends WebAssembly](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8123)

<small>W3C.ORG</small>

This notice from W3C marks the official arrival of WebAssembly. The W3C is the official standards body for the World Wide Web, with this announcement officially declaring that WebAssembly is the fourth language of the web alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is quite a momentous occasion for the technology, and is something that the plugins (Flash, Silverlight) could never have achieved. The future really is bright for WebAssembly.

Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy, originally built by Lyft, that is designed for single services, applications and large microservice “mesh” architectures. It currently has a plugin architecture, with authors writing extensions in C++. However, the recent launch of WebAssembly Hub now allows authors to extend Envoy using a wide range of languages.

### [Introduction to Gate](https://savo.la/introduction-to-gate.html)

Gate is an experiment in portable execution state, making it possible to save the state of a running program at an arbitrary point of execution, and restore it — possibly on a different kind of system.

<small>CPRIMOZIC.NET</small>

This is an epic blog post that delves into audio synthesis in a great deal of detail, combining Rust and WebAssembly with the WebAudio API. Awesome stuff.

### And Finally
