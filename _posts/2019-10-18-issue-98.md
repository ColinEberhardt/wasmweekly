### [WebAssembly Literacy free ebook](http://pop.frontendweekly.co/W2Q9ho)

<small>FRONTENDWEEKLY.CO</small>

I don't know how I missed this when it was released a little while back ... this is a completely free 100 page ebook about WebAssembly! This book is intended for anyone who wants to understand WebAssembly itself, it doesn't cover Rust, C++ or any of the other toolchains, instead it dives into the runtime directly. A fantastic read!

### [Announcing WebAssembly.sh](https://medium.com/wasmer/webassembly-sh-408b010c14db)

Wasmer is a very cool standalone WebAssembly runtime. It uses the WASI interface to provide WebAsssembly modules with the I/O they require to do anything useful. A few weeks back the Wasmer team launched Wasmer-JS, a JavaScript implementation of WASI. This has allowed them to build the WebAssembly Shell - WebAssembly.sh - which executed Wasmer modules directly in the browser. So, so cool.

### [Introduction to WebAssembly for .NET Developers](https://platform.uno/webassembly-for-dot-net-developers/)

<small>PLATFORM.UNO</small>

There is a lot of excitement growing in the C# / .NET community, and the opening line from this article says it all "I really feel that we are on the brink of a revolution. Itâ€™s still very early in the revolution, but I feel like WebAssembly is going to completely change the way we think of web applications."

### And Finally
