### [Chrome v8 adds WebAssembly Threads](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-70)

<small>V8.DE</small>

The current version of WebAssembly is an MVP, with a very limited feature set. There is a public backlog of future features being debates, with one of the most exciting ones being threads. This blog post announces a preview implementation of wasm threads in Chrome! - but don't get too over-excited, wasm will not have native threads, rather, this feature adds atomics, and shared memory access, giving thread-safe constructs. The host environment (i.e. JavaScript) will have to create the threads themselves.

You'd expect C# developers to use Blazor to write forms-based business applications, but not in this case! This is a neat demo of Tetris written entirely in C#, compiled to WebAssembly. Nicely done.

### And Finally ...
