### [Modern C++ Won't Save Us](https://alexgaynor.net/2019/apr/21/modern-c++-wont-save-us/)

<small>ALEXGAYNOR.NET</small>

While this article isn't about WebAssembly specifically, I do feel it is relevant for those of you who might be trying to decide which language to use for your wasm project. This article looks at the  "memory unsafe" nature of C and C++, and concludes "... based on reviewing evidence from numerous large software projects using C and C++, is that we need to be migrating our industry to memory safe by default languages (such as Rust and Swift)"

### [Porting projects to WASI: the flite program](http://www.jakubkonka.com/2019/04/20/wasi-flite.html)

<small>JAKUBKONKA.COM</small>

WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) is a newly proposed system interface for running WebAssembly outside the web. It's at a very early stage, so great to see this blog post where Jakub ports flite, a text-to-speech, to WebAssembly making use of the WASI interface.

### [Lin Clark with Till Schneidereit: WebAssembly in the Real World](https://shows.pippa.io/full-stack-cast/episodes/lin-clark-with-till-schneidereit)

A podcast where Lin Clark and Till Schneidereit discuss how WebAssembly could possibly change the way we build and run software, not only on the browser, but in servers, mobile and IoT devices.

### [Announcing WAPM: The WebAssembly Package Manager](https://medium.com/wasmer/announcing-wapm-the-webassembly-package-manager-18d52fae0eea)

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

The wasmer team, who are creating a standalone runtime for WebAssembly, have recently announced a new package manager for WebAssembly. This announcement did result in some [healthy debate on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WasmWeekly/status/1120747222491107328) regarding WebAssembly needs its own package manager.

### [Running WebAssembly and WASI with .NET](https://ericsink.com/entries/wasm_wasi_dotnet.html?utm_source=paulomorgado&utm_medium=twitter)

You'll no doubt have heard about Blazor, a project that allows you to compiler C# / .NET projects to run in the browser using WebAssembly. This is something a little different, it is a project that attempts to run WebAssembly modules within the .NET common language runtime. It achieves this by transpiling wasm opcodes into .NET Intermediate Language. Very cool!

### And Finally ...

A 'ticket' that [asks Adobe to provide a WebAssembly target for Air / Flash](https://tracker.adobe.com/#/view/AIR-4178275) has 684 upvotes!
