I'm really happy to be hitting send on what is the 100th newsletter ... and what better place to be hitting that big red button than at the WebAssembly SF meetup where I'll be speaking tonight. Thank you all for subscribing!

### [Chip music generated by WebAssembly](https://petersalomonsen.com/articles/webassemblysynth/intro.html)

<small>PETERSALOMONSEN.COM</small>

I spotted this doing the rounds on Twitter a little while back, it's a live coding environment for creating old-school chiptunes using AssemblyScript. This blog post gives some insight into how it was built. 

### [TiDB in the Browser: Running a Golang Database on WebAssembly](https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-in-the-browser-running-a-golang-database-on-webassembly/)

<small>PINGCAP.COM</small>

WebAssembly support for Go applications is very much in its infancy, so it's great to see an experiment like this that shows the potential. This blog post demonstrates the TiDB database running on the web using WebAssembly.

### [Prism - Build frontend web apps with Ruby and WebAssembly](https://github.com/prism-rb/prism)

Similar to Go, WebAssembly support for Ruby is also in its infancy. Prism is a highly experimental framework that allows you to build web applications with Ruby.

### [Wasm3 - A high performance WebAssembly interpreter in C](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/wasm3)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

This is a new and experimental interpreter for WebAssembly, which impressively claims to be around x10 faster than the other options. Using this interpreter you can now run wasm code on Raspberry Pi, routers, ESP2, ESP8266 and more ...

### [WebAssembly Opcodes](https://pengowray.github.io/wasm-ops/html/wasm-opcodes.html)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

If you like hand-coding WebAssembly properly, by which I mean properly, not in WAT (WebAssembly Text Format), but in hex - then this interactive guide is for you. It presents the full instruction set, with some nice interactive mouse-over effects. Now you have no excuse for not writing WebAssembly the hard way! 

### And Finally

Almost as exciting as this newsletter hitting issue #100 is the news that [in-browser debugging of WebAssembly is starting to ship](https://twitter.com/WasmWeekly/status/1193090880523186176).
