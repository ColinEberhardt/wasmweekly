### [Wasm vs. JS - Real time pitch detection](https://bojandjurdjevic.com/2018/WASM-vs-JS-Realtime-pitch-detection/)

<small>BOJANDJURDJEVIC.COM</small>

We all love a good performance comparison ... in this blog post the author looks at real-time pitch detection, where the applications monitors sound from the microphone and determines the pitch of any note it 'hears'. The author took an FFT algorithm and re-wrote it in Rust, then compiled to WebAssembly. He also compared the same algorithm written in JavaScript. And the result? wasm was x8 faster. There's an [online demo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wasm-vs-js-tuner/index.html) and [sourcecode](https://github.com/bojan88/WASM-vs-JS-Pitch-detector) too.


### [Pinky - an NES emulator](http://koute.github.io/pinky-web/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

One of the most popular 'hobby' projects for people playing around with WebAssembly is creating emulators. This one is a NES emulator (an 8-bit console from the 1980s for those too young to remember), written in Rust using the new native WebAssembly backend.


### [clang in the browser](https://tbfleming.github.io/cib/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

Once you can compile and run C++ in the browser, anything is possible, and this is a good demonstration that pushes it to the extremes. Here we have the clang compiler, compiled to WebAssembly, running in the browser, allows you to write C++, that is compiled to WebAssembly, client-side.  Got it? ... Good.


### [WebAssembly A* Pathfinding Demo](https://github.com/jakedeichert/wasm-astar)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

Another Rust demo, with a really good write-up.


### [Dose Response ported to WebAssembly!](https://aimlesslygoingforward.com/blog/2017/12/25/dose-response-ported-to-webassembly/)

<small>AIMLESSLYGOINGFORWARDS.COM</small>

And another one ... a Rust game, ported to WebAssembly, with a very detailed write-up.


### And Finally ...

In response to Spectre and Meltdown, [Mozilla are turning off support for a few browser features](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/03/mitigations-landing-new-class-timing-attack/). Let's hope WebAssembly isn't next!
