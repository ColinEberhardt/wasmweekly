The Christmas season brings with it the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/),a fun and popular coding challenge. For the first time, I decided to join the game, and of course opted for WebAssembly. I toyed with the idea of writing WAT by hand, but instead opted for teh more practical AssemblyScript + WASI.

It has certainly proven a useful exercise, two days in and I've already unearthed a [couple](https://github.com/jedisct1/as-wasi/issues/98) of [bugs](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/issues/1563), both of which were fixed within hours. Kudos to the teams behind these open source projects.

### [In-browser transcoding of video files with FFmpeg and WebAssembly](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/11/23/ffmpeg-webassembly.html)

<small>SCOTTLOGIC.COM</small>

After seeing the release of FFmpeg.wasm a few weeks ago I was keen to give it a go. In this blog post I demonstrate the creation of a simple client-side transcoder that streams data into a video element, with a bit of RxJS thrown in for good measure.

The FFmpeg.wasm API is interesting, you interact with a command-line tool via a virtual file-system. It feels a little like interacting with a Docker container.

### [Lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-lang/lunatic)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

Lunatic is a platform for building actor systems that use WebAssembly instances as actors, another innovative project that capitalises on WebAssembly's isolation model, giving a much more lightweight runtime than Docker or other VM-style approaches.

The project was heavily inspired by Erlang actor model, as described in a blog post that outlines the [motivations behind this project](https://kolobara.com/lunatic/index.html#motivation). It's also worth reading the recent post [Writing Rust the Elixir way](https://dev.to/bkolobara/writing-rust-the-elixir-way-2lm8), from the project's author.

### [Apple Vs The Web](https://alexstlouis.medium.com/apple-vs-the-web-e88b9362c010)

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

This blog post isn't strictly about WebAssembly, but tells an interesting story nonetheless. Apple is a company that likes to be in control, from hardware, through software, they like to own the full ecosystem. This is both a blessing, giving users a user experience of unparalleled quality; and a curse, giving Apple an unhealthy amount of control which it wields for its own benefit. 

### [WebAssembly Summit 2021](https://webassembly-summit.org/)

<small>WEBASSEMBLY-SUMMIT.ORG</small>

WebAssembly Summit, the first conference dedicated to WebAssembly, is back in 2021 - in April-ish! Given the present environment, this event will be virtual, which means anyone can attend. The conference is taking talk submissions, [why not watch last year's talks](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebAssemblySummit) for inspiration?

### [Chimera Kube](https://chimera-kube.github.io/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what this is - but it starts with a 'K' so must be something to do with Kubernetes!

The project description confirms this ...

> A Kubernetes dynamic admission controller that uses WebAssembly policies to validate incoming requests
