As well as writing Programming WebAssembly with Rust, Kevin Hoffman is busy creating Waxosuit - a cloud-native runtime for WebAssembly. Since WebAssembly emerged last year a number of people have seen its potential as a cloud runtime environment, with Fastly and Cloudflare allowing you to run WebAssembly code on their edge networks. Waxosuit uses the wasmer runtime, to create a fully-featured cloud-native runtime suitable for enterprise
