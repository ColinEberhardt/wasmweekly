### [WebAssembly COBOL Pong](https://moxon6.github.io/cobol-js-emscripten/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

I've seen many different languages compiled to WebAssembly over the past few years, but this is the first time I've seen COBOL! You can see the [COBOL sourcecode for the game on GitHub](https://github.com/moxon6/cobol-js-emscripten/blob/master/cob/main.cob). For those of you unfamiliar with the language, COBOL is a very early programming language first released in 1959. However, despite its age, it is still actively used in bank and government mainframes. This fun demo was created by compiling COBOL to C, then C to WebAssembly using Emscripten.

### [CavernOS: Build roguelikes with WebAssembly](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/giu6ua/cavernos_build_roguelikes_with_webassembly/)

<small>REDDIT.COM</small>

Rogue-likes are a specific genre of video game where the player roams from screen-to-screen through dungeon style maps. This reddit post shares an early-stage 'studio' for creating rogue-like games, written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

### [Modern Wasm Starter](https://github.com/TheLartians/modern-wasm-starter)

When it comes to developer tooling, Rust provides some of the best tools for creating WebAssembly modules, they are well-documented, up-to-date and easy to use. In. contrast, the tooling around C++ (Emscripten) feels like such hard work! This is why it's great to see someone assembling a more lightweight and fully features project starter for C++ developers.

### [EF Core and Cosmos DB with Blazor WebAssembly](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/ef-core-and-cosmosdb-with-blazor-webassembly/)

<small>JEREMYLIKNESS.COM</small>

CosmosDB is a cloud database on Microsoft Azure, and Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-relational Mapping (ORM) framework that makes it easy to interact with databases from your code. This epic blog post looks at how both technologies can be put together to allow Blazor to connect directly to a CosmosDB database. 

### [Announcing the first Java library to run WebAssembly: Wasmer JNI](https://medium.com/wasmer/announcing-the-first-java-library-to-run-webassembly-wasmer-jni-89e319d2ac7c)

<small>MEDIUM.COM</small>

Yet another update from the popular WebAssembly runtime Wasmer. In this post they announce support for embedding their runtime within Java, allowing you to use WebAssembly modules from within your Java codebases.

### And Finally ...
