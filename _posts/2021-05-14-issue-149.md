I'm really looking forward to being the track host for [WebAssembly Throughout the Stack](https://plus.qconferences.com/plus2021/track/webassembly-clientserverembedded) at QCon next week. If you're interested in attending, you can use the code `ColinEQPMay21` to get a $50 discount.

### [Hosting SQLite databases on Github Pages](https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/)

Using WebAssembly for client-side search is a concepts I've seen a few times before, e.g. Stork Search - [issue #115](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-115/), or tiny search [issue #121](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-121/). However, the previous examples I've seen are specifically looking at the task of plain-text search of static web content. This article looks at using SQLite for much more general search applications, and has some fantastic embedded examples.

### [Introducing Kubewarden, an Open Source Policy Engine](https://community.suse.com/posts/introducing-kubewarden-an-open-source-policy-engine)

Security is a challenge, and one that is growing as the complexity of our architectures increases. With the rise of DevOps, and more recently DevSecOps, the number of tools and technologies we need to master to create secure infrastructure and applications further compounds the issue.

Kubewarden is a tool that seeks to reduce some of this complexity. It is a tool that allows you to write security policies in various (familiar) languages, which are compiled to WebAssembly. This gives a truly portable policy code that can run anywhere.

### [Updates on WAGI, the WebAssembly Gateway Interface](https://deislabs.io/posts/wagi-updates/)

<small>DEISLABS.IO</small>

WAGI is a super simple WebAssembly server built around the same principles as the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), i.e. HTTP requests are fed to your modules via environment input, and responses are written via standard output. I love the simplicity of this approach and have played with WAGI myself a few times. This blog post introduces some of the new WAGI features, most notably out-bound HTTP requests.

SÃ©bastien Wilmet shares thoughts on WebAssembly outside of the browser, reflecting on Bytecode Alliance and the concept of nanoprocesses.

### [Vino - Code less, build more](https://vino.dev/)

<small>VINO.DEV</small>

Vino is a low-code / no-code platform where applications are composed from data pipelines. I've not had a look at the product itself, but noteably, they are using WebAssembly as their containerised runtime. It's really interesting to see new products adopting WebAssembly as their runtime platform.
