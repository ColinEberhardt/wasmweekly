### [Video: WebAssembly: status, WebIDL Bindings, and roadmap](https://vimeo.com/350135351#webassembly)

<small>VIMEO.COM</small>

The I/O capabilities of the WebAssembly virtual machine are very limited, making it a challenge to efficiently interact with the host environment, for example, manipulating the DOM. This fantastic talk looks at how the WebAssembly specification has been evolving through host bindings, reference types and more recently WebIDL bindings, in order to make this much easier in the future. Once this work is complete, you can expect WebAssembly adoption to increase significantly!
