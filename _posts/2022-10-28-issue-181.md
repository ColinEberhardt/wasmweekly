## [I turned JS into a compiled language (for fun and Wasm)](https://surma.dev/things/compile-js/)

<small>SURMA.DEV</small>

The conventional approach to running JavaScript in a WebAssembly VM is to compile a JS runtime (e.g. QuickJS) to run in WebAssembly, then use that to host your code. This of course results in bloated WebAssembly modules as they contain both your code and host runtime.

What if you could compile JavaScript direct to WebAssembly? Sorry, no, you can't. How about transpiling JavaScript to C++, them compiling that to WebAssembly? Sure, sounds like its worth a try!

This blog post goes a long way down that particular rabbit-hole, creating a proof-of-concept that supports a number of quite modern JavaScript features. However, ultimately it concludes that the likely runtime performance of this approach will be pretty poor.

Oh well, it was worth a try!

## [WASM I/O 2023](https://wasmio.tech/)

It's good to see a conference dedicated to the subject WebAssembly. This is your opportunity to shape this event by proposing talk via their [Call for Papers](https://www.papercall.io/wasmio23). The CFP is open until Jan 17th, giving you a lot of time to work up some ideas!

## [wasm-service - HTMX, wasm and Rust](https://github.com/richardanaya/wasm-service)

HTMX is a lightweight framework (although I'm not sure framework is really the right word to describe it), that allows you to write interactive web applications using hypertext alone. This is a nice alternative to more full-featured frameworks (React, Angular) if you are building something simple. this prototype connects HTMX events to a Rust-based wasm module running on the client. I'm not entirely sure what advantage this gives, but I love the creativity!
