### [JavaScript to Rust and Back Again: A wasm-bindgen Tale](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/04/javascript-to-rust-and-back-again-a-wasm-bindgen-tale/)

<small>MOZILLA.ORG</small>

The interface between WebAssembly and JavaScript is currently a massive pain point. Your only options for passing data between the two are directly four numeric types, and indirectly via linear memory (i.e. an array). This restriction effects the JS / wasm interface irrespective of which language you are using (C++, Rust, AssemblyScript).

This blog post introduces wasm-bindgen, a new tool from the Mozilla team, that generates code in both Rust and wasm that creates richer bindings, allowing you to seamlessly pass strings, structs, and even DOM objects. It is a kind of 'future polyfill' for [host bindings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings). The tool is also language agnostic by design, so expect to see the bindings improve in other languages too.
