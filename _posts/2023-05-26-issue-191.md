## [FAAS in Go with WASM, WASI and Rust](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/faas-in-go-with-wasm-wasi-and-rust/)

<small>THEGREENPLACE.NET</small>

This blog post has a bit of everything, writing Go applications using WASI, creating a plugin system, writing Rust/Wasm applications - and a bit of hand-crafted WAT (WebAssembly Text Format) too. All these technologies come together to create a simple FAAS (Function as a service) runtime, with WebAssembly plugin support.

## [Performance in the spotlight: WebAssembly profiling for everyone](https://blog.stealthrocket.tech/performance-in-the-spotlight-webassembly-profiling-for-everyone/)

<small>STEALTHROCKET.TECH</small>

When it comes to writing high-performance, low cost, applications, performance profiling is a vital tool. The allow you to instrument various dynamic aspects of your code as it is executed, for example, looking at call stack depth, the time spent in various functions, memory usage / allocations and more.

This blog post describes a brand new tool, wzprof, a cross-language CPU and memory profiler specifically designed fro WebAssembly. It works by inserting instrumentation points into your WebAssembly modules, that allow measurement of function entry / exit timings.

## [Mitigating PHP Vulnerabilities with WebAssembly](https://wasmlabs.dev/articles/mitigating-php-vulnerabilities-with-webassembly/)

<small>WASMLABS.DEV</small>

PHP is a popular and widely used programming language, and has become especially popular for web application framework developers, such as PHP. However, the PHP ecosystem is not immune to vulnerabilities (is any ecosystem?).

This blog post takes a look at a vulnerability in Archive_Tar, where a user can craft a filename which results in files being written to unexpected locations. This is a pretty classic web-server vulnerability.

The author proceeds to demonstrate how PHP code can be run within a WebAssembly sandbox, where the deny-by-default security model mitigates this attack. A great demonstration of the value of the WebAssembly security model.


## [Sumopaint](https://paint.sumo.app/)

A very cool WebAssembly-powered painting app with Stable Diffusion support (that's generative AI if you've been living under a rock this past year)

## [WasmCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/)

<small>LINUXFOUNDATION.ORG</small>

And finally, Linux Foundation have just announced WasmCon, which looks like the biggest WebAssemby conference to date!
