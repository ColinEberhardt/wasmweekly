This week the annual Google I/O conference took place in California. If you haven't seen it already, I'd highly recommend watching the [future of the web session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnYq7JapeDA) which focussed on WebAssembly. Most of the links in this week's issue are from that talk.

### [AutoCAD Web](https://web.autocad.com/#/)

<small>AUTOCAD.COM</small>

This is probably the most significant commercial usage of WebAssembly so far, the full AutoCAD design application is now available on the web, via a 9 MByte wasm file, compiled from C++. Unfortunately it doesn't work on Firefox - [feel the rage on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8i4w0w/firefox_pioneered_webassembly_yet_autocad_web/)!

### [CodeLabs Physics Engine](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/hour-chipmunk/index.html?index=../../io2018#0)

<small>GOOGLE.COM</small>

A great tutorial on compiling the Chipmunk physics engine to WebAssembly, with a cool 'hour glass' demo.

### [Platform Uno](http://platform.uno/Playground/index.html)

<small>PLATFORM.UNO</small>

A UWP (Universal Windows Platform) bridge for iOS, Android and WebAssembly, which will be free and open sourced (soon)

### And Finally ...

A practical application of WebAssembly ... a [Human to Dog translator](https://humantoanimal.com/)!
