It's been a bit of a quiet week on the WebAssembly front, so in this newsletter I'm taking the opportunity to briefly reflect on the current state of language support ...

### WebAssembly Language Support

Support for compiling to WebAssembly from various languages is moving really quickly, here's a quick round-up:

- **C / C++** - has very good (production ready) support via [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/), or other [minimal LLVM-based toolchains](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webassembly).
- **Rust** - support officially landed last week, with Rust [using Emscripten under-the-hood](https://hackernoon.com/compiling-rust-to-webassembly-guide-411066a69fde), although recently they have [moved to LLVM](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45905).
- **C#** - has highly experimental support via [Blazor](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/Blazor), however this currently requires embedding a .NET runtime into the WASM.
- **TypeScript** - has highly experimental support via [AssemblyScript](http://assemblyscript.org/), with the author working on a v.Next compiler. The other TypeScript projects (TurboScipt, speedy.js) have stalled.
- **Java** - via [TeaVM](http://teavm.org/), which looks relatively mature.
- **Kotlin** - Kotlin/Native 0.4 [gained experimental support](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/11/kotlinnative-v0-4-released-objective-c-interop-webassembly-and-more/) of WebAssembly.
- **Go** - support is under active development, with a [recent update on this tracking issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18892).

Making machine code look pretty - a colourful way to look at WASM binaries!

### [WAVM - A WebAssembly Virtual Machine](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/WAVM)

Want to run WebAssembly outside of a browser? With WAVM you can! This is a standalone virtual machine for executing WebAssembly.

[Elastic Man](http://www.adultswim.com/etcetera/elastic-man/) has to be the wackiest WebAssembly demo on the web!
