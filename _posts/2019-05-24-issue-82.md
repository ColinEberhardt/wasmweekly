### [Build your own WebAssembly Compiler](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/17/webassembly-compiler.html)

<small>SCOTTLOGIC.COM</small>

Have you ever wanted to build your own compiler? ... of course you have! This detailed article looks at how to create your own programming language that compiles to WebAssembly. It's an awesome must-read article. Although I am slightly biased, as I wrote it ;-)

### [Wasm on the Blockchain](https://avive.github.io/wasm_on_the_blockchain/#/)

<small>GITHUB.IO</small>

This free event in Berlin, June 8-9th, sounds awesome - it already has a packed agenda, with some amazing speakers from wasmer, Mozilla, Parity and more. Sounds like this is going to be a great (and free) gathering.

### [WebAssembly at eBay: A Real-World Use Case](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/webassembly-at-ebay-a-real-world-use-case/)

<small>EBAYINC.COM</small>

As I've mentioned before, I always enjoy reading about real-world applications of WebAssembly. This blog post, from the eBay team, looks at how they are using WebAssembly for barcode scanning, with some fantastic stats from A/B testing with real users. Their final solution, which 'races' three different algorithms is interesting - and has drawn some skepticism. Either way, fascinating reading.

### [Faster script loading with BinaryAST?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/binary-ast/)

<small>CLOUDFLARE.COM</small>

This article isn't actually about WebAssembly, instead it looks at BinaryAST, a mechanism for delivering JavaScript to the browser in AST format rather than text. Why should you read it? Because it addresses some of the same issues that WebAssembly does.
