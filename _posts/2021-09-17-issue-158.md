## [Introduction to Hippo: the WebAssembly PaaS](https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-hippo/)

<small>DEISLABS.IO</small>

The Deislabs team are keen advocates of WebAssembly and I've featured a number of their creations in the past, including WAGI (Issue [#136](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-136/)) and Krustlet (Issue [#115](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-115/)). This blog post announces the launch of their latest creation - Hippo, a self-hosted Platform as a Service (PaaS). Thsi gives you everything you need to stand-up a WebAssembly-based runtime for executing cloud functions.

And another new platform built on WebAssembly, this time a platform for the execution of code within Trusted Execution Environments, a secure area of processors.

It's great to see another post from Martin Moxon, who previously run a COBOL-based PONG game using WebAssembly ([#118](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-118/)). This post looks at running WebAssembly on the NintendoDS using Wasm3, an interpreter that is popular for running WebAssembly in embedded environments. With Wasm3 up and running, the game itself was written in AssemblyScript.

This one is a bit of an epic, and I must admit, I haven't had the chance to fully digest this post yet .. if you're into low-level computing concepts, this post is likely well worth looking at.
